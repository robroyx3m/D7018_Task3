## 3c

# Results from omtting \0 in the two different prgograms
When omitting the \0 character in the case of the 3a implementation the program ends with a panic and
the following error message is supplied: 
'thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 0 but the index is 0' 

When omitting the \0 character in the case of the 3b implementation the program ends with a panic and
the following error message is supplied: 
'thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 131 but the index is 131'

# Analasys
As the programs are trying to run until they find a termination character (\0) they will try to go outisde of 
the given arrays in searching for it. In Rust this is not allowed and it deals with us trying to do this by 
panicking and shutting down the programs. As 3a stores all it's variables on the stack and thus keeps 
local access to these variables this one should be safer than the heap allocation in 3b, where we need to go 
and search for the data on the heap, thuis requiring code that the Rust engine deems unsafe.
